# Intcatch_pixelwise_segmentation


This repository does include all the code to reproduce the results in:

Waterline and obstacle detection in images from low-cost autonomous boats for environmental monitoring 

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.robot.2019.103346

The data used for the training of the neural network are contained in:

- Training/ , Training_v2/

- Validation/, Validation_v2/

while the test data are in:

- Test/, Test_v2/

The training of the network can be carried out trough the Training.ipynb notebook. 

Or taking advantage of google colab at: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1dTWlUoeNledtqJ2MvcREAh1IPrGLKdxj

While all the results of the paper can be reproduced with the results.ipynb notebook.


The tool used to create the pixelwise label mask trough superpixel segmentation is avaiable at:
